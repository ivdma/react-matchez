## Overview

- This component represents a **shape** to be matched.
- Its props are the pattern: the shape of value you expect for this branch.
- Its `children` will be rendered if the shape defined within its other props
  match the `value` prop passed to its `Match` parent.
- It takes **one** type parameter: the shape of the `value` prop passed to its
  parent. Useful for type inference.
- This is pretty much a **lighter** version of
  [Exact](/docs/overview/components/exact).
