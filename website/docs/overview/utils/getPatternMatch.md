## Overview

- This function is a typing helper and returns typed versions of the components
  APIâ€”so that you don't have to manually type `With`, `When`, etc. each time you
  use them.
- It takes either:
  - Two **regular parameters**: `value` and `strict`. This alternative is ideal
    when you want the `Shape` to be inferred.
  - Two **type parameters**: `Shape` and `Strict`. This alternative is ideal
    when you have an `interface`/`type` for your `Shape` and you just want to
    pass them.
