## Overview

- This component represents a **condition** to be satisfied.
- Its `children` will be rendered if the `predicate` function returns a truthy
  value.
- If you pass the `value` prop to its parent, it's going to be available as the
  first parameter of your `predicate` function.
- It takes **one** type parameter: the shape of the `value` prop passed to its
  parent. Useful for type inference.

## Examples

<CodePlayground
  id="react-matchez-examples-when-slzkk"
