## Overview

- This component is the wrapper for the matching cases.
- The only required prop is its `children`.
- Valid `children` are: `With`, `When`, and `Otherwise`.
- If you plan on having `With` cases, then you need to pass a `value` prop.
- You are required to have at least one `Otherwise` component as children.
- Just like [`Match`](/docs/overview/components/match), but it will return
  **only the first match**.

## Examples

<CodePlayground
  id="react-matchez-examples-switch-rdnjg"
